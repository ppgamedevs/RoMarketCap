## Core Questions Answered

### Who is RoMarketCap for?

**Primary Users:**
1. **Startup Founders** - Want to understand their market position, improve ROMC score, benchmark against competitors
2. **Angel Investors / Syndicates** - Need dealflow, due diligence data, portfolio monitoring
3. **Journalists / Analysts** - Require data for articles, reports, market analysis
4. **Corporate BD / M&A Scouts** - Need company data for partnerships, acquisitions, market intelligence

**Secondary Users:**
- VCs and funds
- Government agencies
- Research institutions
- Service providers (lawyers, accountants, consultants)

### What problem exists because Romania has no market visibility?

**The Opaque Market Problem:**

1. **For Founders:**
   - No way to benchmark against competitors
   - No visibility into market position
   - No data-driven way to improve company valuation
   - Difficulty attracting investors without market context

2. **For Investors:**
   - No systematic dealflow discovery
   - Manual due diligence is time-consuming and incomplete
   - No way to monitor portfolio companies systematically
   - Missing market context for investment decisions

3. **For Analysts:**
   - No comprehensive data source for market reports
   - Reliance on incomplete or outdated information
   - Difficulty tracking market trends and movements
   - No standardized scoring system for comparisons

4. **For the Ecosystem:**
   - Fragmented information across multiple sources
   - No single source of truth
   - Limited transparency hinders growth
   - Difficulty identifying high-potential companies

### Why this is inevitable, not optional

**Market Forces:**

1. **Digital Transformation:** All markets are moving toward data-driven decision making. Romania cannot remain opaque.

2. **Investor Demand:** International investors require transparency and data. Romania must provide it to compete.

3. **Founder Expectations:** Modern founders expect visibility and benchmarking tools. This is table stakes.

4. **Regulatory Trends:** Increasing transparency requirements (EU regulations, anti-corruption measures).

5. **Competitive Necessity:** Companies that understand their market position outperform those that don't.

6. **Ecosystem Maturity:** A mature startup ecosystem requires market visibility. Romania is reaching that stage.

**The Inevitability:**
- Either we build it, or someone else will
- The data exists (ANAF, public records, web signals)
- The technology exists (ML, APIs, data aggregation)
- The demand exists (founders, investors, analysts asking for it)
- The timing is right (Romanian ecosystem is maturing)

## Founder Narrative (Anti-Opaque Markets)

### The Story

**The Problem We Saw:**
Romania has over 1.2 million private companies, but zero market visibility. Founders don't know how they compare to competitors. Investors can't find dealflow. Analysts lack data for reports. The market is opaque, fragmented, and inefficient.

**Why We Built RoMarketCap:**
We believe transparent markets are better markets. When founders understand their position, they make better decisions. When investors have data, they make better investments. When analysts have visibility, they write better reports. Transparency drives growth.

**Our Mission:**
Make Romania's private company market visible, transparent, and data-driven. Not just for the elite, but for everyone who needs market intelligence.

**The Enemy:**
Opaque markets. Information asymmetry. Fragmented data. Manual processes. The status quo that keeps Romania's private market invisible.

**Our Promise:**
Daily updated ROMC scores. Accurate forecasts. Complete data. For founders, investors, and analysts. Market visibility for private companies in Romania.
